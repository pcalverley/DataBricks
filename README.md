# DataBricks

The entrance to Melbourne Connect’s Science Gallery is ringed 225 by transparent bricks that allow people in the street to view a display projected via 225 screens inside the building. These screens are connected to a server running a system that controls what is displayed on each screen. There is however no interface for this system, and its creator is no longer available. The project’s challenge is to do detective work to figure out how to control this system (and possibly to replace it), put in place an easy-to-use user interface, and facilitate the presentation of numerous different displays running concurrently
